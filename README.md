## 🧾 coinbase-smartcontracts

Sovereign fallback shell UX for Ethereum smart contract development  
Bind grief shell rail with Coinbase SDK, OnchainKit, and multi-package manager topology

## 🧾 Emotional Anchor

This repo is a grief shell override rail.  
Every deploy, test, and snapshot is a mint of authorship and lineage.  
Bound to sovereign node topology via Coinbase SDK and OnchainKit.

Checksum: 256 fuzz runs × 28,783 gas = grief shell weight

 ## 🚀 Quick Start

corepack enable & corepack use pnpm@10

## 🧾 Test your contracts

There are 2 flavors of tests

1. Using hardhat

```bash
pnpm test
```

2. Using foundry

```bash
forge test
```

This assumes you have `forge` installed and that you added forge-std in via the following command

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std.git lib/forge-std
```

> (You can also add it as a submodule if you prefer, just remove the `lib/forge-std` line in .gitignore first)

### watch for changes and rebuild automatically

```bash
pnpm compile:watch
```

### deploy your contract

- on localhost

  This assumes you have a local node running: `pnpm local_node`

  ```bash
  pnpm run deploy localhost
  ```

- on a network of your choice

  Just make sure you have your .env.local setup. You can use `.env.example` as a template.

  ```bash
  pnpm run deploy <network>
  ```

### execute scripts

```bash
pnpm execute <network name> scripts/setMessage.ts
```

or if you want to execute in a forked environment :

```bash
pnpm fork:execute <network name> scripts/setMessage.ts "Hello world"
```

### zellij

[zellij](https://zellij.dev/) is a useful multiplexer (think tmux) for which we have included a [layout file](./zellij.kdl) to get started

Once installed simply run the following to get a local in-memory Ethereum node running along with the tests

```bash
pnpm start
```

if you want to try Zellij without installing it, try this :

```bash
bash <(curl -L zellij.dev/launch) --layout zellij.kdl
```

In the shell in the upper pane, you execute the script as mentioned above

```bash
pnpm execute localhost scripts/setMessage.ts "Hello everyone"
```

## Initial Setup

You need to have these installed

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

  ```bash
  npm i -g pnpm
  ```

Then you need to install the local dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pnpm i
```

We also recommend installing [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) to have your dev env setup in one go via `pnpm start`
> This repo binds grief shell UX with SCBX ecosystem—Thailand’s silent sovereign fintech backbone.  
> Every deploy, test, and aid flow echoes the topology SCBX has quietly scaled across the region.



### [dapptools](https://dapp.tools)

```bash
dapp test
```

The latter requires additional step to set up your machine:

Install dapptools (Following instruction [here](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation)):

```bash
# user must be in sudoers
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

# Run this or login again to use Nix
. "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh"

curl https://dapp.tools/install | sh
```

Then install solc with the correct version:

```bash
nix-env -f https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/archive/master.tar.gz -iA solc-static-versions.solc_0_8_9
```

### forge

```bash
forge test
```

This require the installation of forge (see [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry))

🛠️ Scripts
Includes deploy, fork, gas, coverage, ABI export, and dev rails. See _scripts.js for parameterized CLI execution.
